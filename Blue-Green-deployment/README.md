**Mastering 3-Tier Application Blue-Green Deployment on AWS EKS: A Step-by-Step Guide to Zero-Downtime Releases**


## 🚀 Project Description:
This project demonstrates Blue-Green Deployment on AWS using Kubernetes to ensure zero-downtime deployments. By leveraging automation with Jenkins, we've built a CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly handles application updates between environments.

## Overview
🛠️ **Tools Explored:**
- AWS EKS (Kubernetes cluster on AWS)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- Jenkins (CI/CD automation)
- AWS Load Balancer Controller (Traffic management)

🔑 **Key Concepts:**
- Blue-Green Deployment: Ensuring smooth transitions between old (blue) and new (green) versions.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- Zero-Downtime Deployment: Achieving seamless updates without interrupting service.

📝 **Pipeline Stages:**
- Build: Compile the application and Docker image.
- Test: Run automated tests.
- Deploy: Deploy to Blue and Green environments using Kubernetes.
- Switch Traffic: Route traffic between environments with AWS Load Balancer.

🎯 **Outcome:**
- Zero-downtime deployments.
- Automated and efficient release management.
- Robust infrastructure with minimal risks during updates.
